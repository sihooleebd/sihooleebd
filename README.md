I’m a developer focused on building tools that make information more accessible and beautiful. Most of my current energy is directed toward the **Typst** ecosystem, where I’m crafting modules to bridge the gap between complex math and elegant documentation.

### ✦ Current Focus
- **Noteworthy**: Developing a comprehensive suite of Typst modules for academic and technical writing.
- **Emergence**: Exploring JavaScript-based systems and interactive logic.
- **Open Source**: Contributing to the Typst community and refining adaptive rendering techniques.

### ✦ Tools of the Trade
- **Languages**: Typst, JavaScript, Python, C++
- **Focus Areas**: Technical Typesetting, UI/UX Design, Logic Systems, Competitive Programming
- **Workflow**: Neovim, Git, and a lot of coffee(like a lot of it.).
